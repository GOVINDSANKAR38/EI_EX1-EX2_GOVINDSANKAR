  - Strategy Pattern – Calculate trip cost based on travel mode  
  - Observer Pattern – Monitor weather data in real-time  

- **Creational Patterns**:
  - Singleton Pattern – Manage a database connection pool  
  - Factory Pattern – Dynamically create notifications (Email/SMS/Push)  

- **Structural Patterns**:
