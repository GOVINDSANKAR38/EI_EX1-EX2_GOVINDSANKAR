# Java Design Patterns & Smart Home System Projects 🚀

This repository contains **two Java console applications** demonstrating **Behavioral, Creational, and Structural design patterns** along with **SOLID principles**.  
Both projects use **interactive terminal input** to showcase practical applications of design patterns in real-world scenarios.

## 📌 Project 1 – Design Patterns Examples (Exercise 1)

**Type:** Java Console App  

### 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Behavioral, Creational, and Structural design patterns** in Java.  
Each pattern is implemented with **interactive console input**, making it easy to test and understand their usage.

### 🏗 Features

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- **Strategy Pattern** – Calculate trip cost based on travel mode (Car, Train, Flight)  
- **Observer Pattern** – Monitor weather data in real-time (Mobile App, LED Display)

**Creational Patterns:**
- **Singleton Pattern** – Manage a database connection pool  
- **Factory Pattern** – Dynamically create notifications (Email/SMS/Push)

**Structural Patterns:**
- **Decorator Pattern** – Add toppings dynamically to a pizza order  
- **Adapter Pattern** – Use multiple payment gateways (PayPal, Stripe, GPay, Paytm) through a unified interface  

### ⚙️ Getting Started

#### Requirements
